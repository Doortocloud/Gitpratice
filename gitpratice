comes to my pipeline, our source code is stored our github repositorty, once we do some commits then webhook automatically will tigger the jenkins pipeline and maven start buildup the code in artifactoy which stored in jenkins working directory. before maven come to picture, we are implementing sonarqube mainly forcheking the source code quality and bugs in code and vulnerabilities. as the qulity gate meteric we will decide whether we need to bulid the code or file build. once quality gate passed the it moved to bulid state and docker will convert the artifact to docker image and that image will push to nexus repository. we are using nexus mainly for storing the docker images, so we can pull that images and deploy in as a container on the kubernetes cluster.. Here we are using prometheus and grafana for monitoring all our applications.
comes to my role and responsibility. 

we are working agile
